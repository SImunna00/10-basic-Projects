                Former President of Bangladesh

                   <b> Sheikh Mujibur Rahman[c]</b> (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), popularly known by the honorific prefix Bangabandhu[d] (lit. 'Friend of Bengal'), was a Bangladeshi politician, revolutionary, statesman, activist and diarist. As a politician, Mujib had held continuous positions either as Bangladesh's president or as its prime minister from April 1971 until his assassination in August 1975.[5][6] Mujib successfully led the Bangladeshi independence movement and restored the Bengali sovereignty after over two centuries following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, for which he is honoured as the 'Father of the Nation' in Bangladesh.[7] In 2011, the fifteenth constitutional amendment in Bangladesh referred to Sheikh Mujib as the Father of the Nation who declared independence; these references were enshrined in the fifth, sixth, and seventh schedules of the constitution.[8] His Bengali nationalist ideology, socio-political theories, and political doctrines are sometimes called Mujibism.
